										<h3>Sustainable urbanization and walkability</h3>
										<p>Making cities sustainable means creating career and business opportunities, safe and affordable housing, and building resilient societies and economies. It involves enhancing urban planning and management in participatory and inclusive ways, as well as investing in public transport,  green public spaces and pedestrian mobility.

										</p>

										<p>Walkability in urban areas plays a central role in the sustainable development of cities by reducing traffic and air pollution. Well-planed cities should provide safe and comfortable pedestrian infrastructure so more people will walk, with a positive impact on environment, health and overall quality of life.

										<h3>56% of World’s population live in cities</h3>
										<p>Today 4.4 billion people live in urban areas, corresponding to 56% of the world’s population. By 2050, urban areas are projected to house 68% of the global population, with one in every three people that will live in cities of at least half a million inhabitants.</p>
										<p>Growth in the urban population is driven by overall population increase and by the upward shift in the percentage living in urban areas. Together, these two factors are projected to add 2.3 billion to the world’s urban population by 2050, with almost 90% of this growth happening in Asia and Africa.

										<h3>Sustainable urbanization is key to successful development</h3>
										<p>Urban growth is closely related to the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, social and environmental. As the world continues to urbanize, sustainable development depends increasingly on the successful management of urban area. </p>

										<p>Well-managed urbanization can help to maximize the benefits of agglomeration while minimizing environmental degradation, also ensuring that everyone has equal access to infrastructures and social services, such as pedestrian mobility.</p>

										<p>Making cities and communities more sustainable is also one of United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals to protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.

									<h3>Measuring walkability in our city</h3>
									<p>The Pedestrian Level of Service (PLOS) is a qualitative measure of the quality of the pedestrian infrastructure, allowing city planners to be aware of the current status of the walking conditions on road and street corridors. </p>

									<p>The model focuses primarily on the characteristics of the road infrastructure, taking into account a number of parameters, such as width of sidewalk, number of vehicular lanes, traffic volume and traffic speed, presence of buffers or bike lanes etc., and it returns a numerical value that summarizes the overall quality of the pedestrian infrastructure.</p>
									<p>In our project we applied PLOS – and an upgraded version call “Enhanced PLOS” – to assess the quality of the pedestrian infrastructure in “Isola”, a neighbor in Municipio 9, Milan, Italy.
