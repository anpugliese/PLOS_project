									<h3>Data Collection</h3>
									<p>Data collection is the first and one of the most delicate and expensive steps in any GIS project as it involves on-field surveying, a time consuming task.</p>

									<p>
									Data collection was performed directly at the site that was designated to us, by going into each street and filling all the data, together with GPS coordinates, inside the Epicollect5, a mobile application also used and supported by the Center for Genomic Pathogen, University of Oxford and the British Big Data Institute. 

									</p>
									

								</div>
								<div class="col col1 first">
									<div class="align-center">
										<img src="images/epi.png" alt="" height="200" /></a>
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>
							
							<p>The data we collected included: number of lanes, on street parking, buffer, width of sidewalk, curb ramps, lightings, width of bike lanes and shoulders. For each data entry time, GPS coordinates and accuracy were also recorded by Epicollect5.

							</p>
							<hr class="major" />
							<h3>Data transfer</h3>
							<p>Data transfer was a simple task that we performed by using Epicollect5 mobile application.  Once the field data collection was concluded, it was uploaded to Epicollect5 cloud service and then downloaded as a csv format to our computers. 
							Since the points were collected by each of us using her/his Epicollect5 account, the data transfer consisted of 4 different csv files which, later, had to be merged before processing.

							</p>
							<hr class="major" />
							<h3>Data processing</h3>
							<p>This step was certainly the most challenging of the whole process, not only because of the number of actions involved, but also due to the fact that some data cleaning was required, a task that could not be completely automated. </p>
							<p>
							The main steps in our data processing were:
							</p>
							
							<div id="ul" style="list-style-type:none;">
								<li>1. Download data</li>
								<li>2. Merge data into a unique file</li>
								<li>3. Check data consistency</li>
								<li>4. Import data to QGIS</li>
								<li>5. Display data in QGIS</li>
								<li>6. Improve data quality (e.g. manual relocation of points that were misplaced due to low accuracy)</li>

							</div>
							<hr class="major" />
							
							<h3>Data Analysis</h3>

							<p>Data analysis can be seen as the most interesting part of the project, since here we elaborate and visualize the final result of our project. Data analysis was performed using QGIS, a free and open source  GIS software developed by Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo). Using QGIS we were able to process the data located in our Epicollect5 csv file to project it and compute PLOS/EPLOS formulas and, finally, to visualize results on the map.
							</p>

							<hr class="major" />

							<h3>Data presentation</h3>

							<p>The final step was to expose the results of the analysis through a website. This step required mastering several technologies, including:</p>

							<div id="ul" style="list-style-type:none;">

								<li>1. HTML web page programming</li>
								<li>2. CSS website styling</li>
								<li>3. Java interfaces</li>
								<li>4. Geoserver storage and implementation</li>
								<li>5. GeoJason files visualization</li>
								<li>6. GitHub files hosting and visualization</li>
								<li>7. Map layers</li>
							</div>

							<p>After the collection and consolidation of all these technologies we obtained this web GIS, where everything works in a harmonious and efficient way.</p>
