									<h3>Data Collection</h3>
									<p>The first step in our workflow was data collection. We went to “Isola” – the neighborhood of Milan assigned to our team – on December 2nd, 2019 and performed direct on street measurements. Data collection took us 2 hours approximately.</p>

									<p>Since data collection implied to walk along every street and we were a team of four people, we subdivided the area that had to be sampled into two zones of roughly equal size. After surveying the first street segment all of us together to ensure a common measurement methodology, each pair was assigned a zone. This approach allowed us to halve data collection time while retaining homogeneity in data.

							<p>Since our goal was to assess the comfort and safety of the existing pedestrian infrastructure by means of PLOS and Enhanced PLOS models, for each segment in the assigned street network we surveyed the following variables:

							<p>Data measurements were recorded on Epicollect5 – a mobile and web application for free and easy data collection developed and maintained by Imperial College London – by filling a predesigned form. For each surveying point the phone device was geolocalized and its position coordinates and accuracy recorded on Epicollect5. We repeated the glocalization process until reaching an accuracy of no more than 20 meters.

							<p>Collected data were later download in csv format from Epicollect5 website, under the project folder GISlab_2019_PLOS. Since the data points were collected by each of us using her/his Epicollect5 account four different csv files had to be download and then merged before the next step of data processing.
							</p>
							<p>The other data for PLOS and Enhanced PLOS calculation (traffic volume, vehicular speed, pedestrian crossings, points of interest, public transports stops, public services) were provided to us by Systematica or Politecnico di Milano. Finally, we assumed a fixed width of 3.5 m for the outside lane that serves vehicles traveling along the street segment.</p>
