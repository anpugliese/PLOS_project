							<h1>About walkability</h1>
							<div></div>
							<p>Walking is the most basic yet an indispensable mode of transportation since the beginning of human civilization, but the need for a faster mobility has eventually discouraged the pedestrian culture in many places. </p>

							<p>Moreover, the increase in vehicular traffic over the past few decades has negatively impacted the overall quality of the walking environment, especially in cities where the road infrastructures were conceived before the advent of cars, as it is often the case in Europe.</p>

							<p>However, the increase in urban population, which in turn implies larger flows of moving people, and the growing awareness of the general public about environmental issues has created the need for a more sustainable mobility and municipally are required to assess the current level of service of their road infrastructures and to adapt them or even rethink their mobility model.</p>

							<p>Pedestrian mobility plays a key role in this context, not to mention the importance of walking in terms of health of people, and thus it is important to provide safe and comfort conditions for pedestrians in order to encourage the walking practice.</p>

							<h2 id="content">The Pedestrian Level of Service</h2>
							<p>The Pedestrian Level of service (PLOS) model is aimed exactly at assessing the quality of the pedestrian infrastructure, allowing city planners to be aware of the current status of the walking conditions on road and street corridors.</p>

							<p>The PLOS is a qualitative measure of quality of the walkways and it leads to an objective and sound evaluations of pedestrians’ perception and response to roadway environment. The model focuses primarily on the characteristics of the road infrastructure, taking into account a number of parameters, such as width of sidewalk, number of vehicular lanes, traffic volume and traffic speed, presence of buffers or bike lanes etc., and it returns a numerical value that summarizes the overall quality of the pedestrian infrastructure, the lower the output value the  better quality of the infrastructure as shown in table below:</p>
